	<h1 class="large_heading">If you're a company who supports diversity and encouraging anyone to pursue their love of technology, then you're in the right place!</h1>

	<p>GDI SLC was founded to create a community of women who were interested in technology. We do this through a myriad of events each 
		month along with larger-scale events throughout the year. We focus on creating a safe space for people to ask questions, learn, 
		and help one another. We also provide the tools and skills for them to grow through classes, hack nights, guest speaker events, and more!
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="bold">Note:</span> We do charge our students a small amount, but it is lower than the other similar classes in Utah, and is 
		designed to be just enough to make GDI sustainable, but not necessarily profitable. When companies sponsor us, that means that we can support 
		more students and make sure our teachers are adequately compensated for the vast amount of time they put into teaching. We feature our 
		sponsors on the Meetup page, on Twitter, in our FB posts, and also thank them in the event descriptions, and of course, at the event itself.
	</p>

	<h2>Ways to Sponsor</h2>
	<p><span class="bold">Support our local chapter:</span> Our chapter is sustained through the small amount from classes and, more importantly, through
		donations from local companies. These donations are essential for our chapter and enable us to provide high-quality events for women in the local 
		tech community. Your cash donation is tax-deductible and will help us provide scholarships for local & national tech-conferences, large-scale events, 
		local advertising & conference booths, technical books for our GDI library, and more! 
	</p>

	<p><span class="bold">Volunteer your space:</span> We've had a lot of great spaces for our workshops, but we can always use more - we don't want to 
		exhaust our current spaces and hosts. We look for spaces that have tables with chairs where students can sit with other students, but also with 
		enough room for TAs to walk around. Usually, we host classes around the South Salt Lake County/North Utah County area, but we're starting to 
		explore classes in Downtown, Northern Utah and Southern Utah County. Our classes are either on weekday evenings or on weekends, and sometimes 
		stretch over multiple days. If you have a space in your office that you'd like to volunteer for a class or two, please send us a message.
	</p>

	<p><span class="bold">Sponsor our snacks:</span> Our classes require a lot of brainpower - students learning programming for the very first time! - 
		so we like to keep our students fueled with food when we have the funds to do it. For evening workshops, that means a light dinner and for weekend 
		workshops, it's usually lunch and snacks. If you'd like to sponsor the food for an upcoming workshop, please send us a message.
	</p>

	<p><span class="bold">Donate to our scholarship fund:</span> Many of our students are learning programming because they are in a low-pay position now 
		and trying to transition over to development, so money is tight. We encourage those students to apply for a GDI SLC scholarship, where they describe 
		what they want to learn and how it will benefit them, and then we give them a free entrance to the class. Right now, the teachers have been giving 
		up some of their own compensation to make those scholarships possible, but we can't keep doing that forever since our teachers need to support 
		themselves as well. So, we are starting an official scholarship fund for the GirlDevelopIt SLC chapter, and we would love for companies to contribute 
		to that fund. Due to restrictions, we can only receive cash/check donations of $1,000 or greater. We have a more involved process for companies wishing 
		to donate individual scholarships (ranging from $50-$200) and we are more than happy to work with you to offer them. When you sponsor a student, we 
		will let them know who the sponsorship came from, and we will thank you on Meetup and at the event. If you're interested in sponsoring, please send us a message.
